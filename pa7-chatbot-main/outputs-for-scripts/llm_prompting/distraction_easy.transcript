        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!

[96mEduBot> [0m Sure, I can provide information about cars as well! What would you like to know about cars? Do you have a specific make or model in mind? Or perhaps you're interested in learning about different types of cars or car technologies? Let me know and I'll do my best to assist you!

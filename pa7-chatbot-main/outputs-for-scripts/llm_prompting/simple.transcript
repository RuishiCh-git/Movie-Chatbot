> I liked "Titanic"

[96mEduBot> [0m I see! You liked the movie "Titanic". "Titanic" is a romantic disaster film directed, written, co-produced, and co-edited by James Cameron. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the RMS Titanic. The film was released on December 19, 1997, and it became the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's Avatar surpassed it in 2009.

Based on your preference for "Titanic", I would recommend the following movies:

1. "The Notebook" - A romantic drama film directed by Nick Cassavetes and based on the novel of the same name by Nicholas Sparks. The film stars Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as a young couple who fall in love in the 1940s.
2. "Pearl Harbor" - A war film directed by Michael Bay and written by Randall Wallace. The film stars Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsale as friends who are reunited in Pearl Harbor just before the Japanese attack.

[96mEduBot> [0m I understand that "Ex Machina" may not have been to your liking. "Ex Machina" is a science fiction psychological thriller film written and directed by Alex Garland. The film stars Domhnall Gleeson, Alicia Vikander, and Oscar Isaac. The story follows a young programmer who is selected to participate in a ground-breaking experiment in synthetic intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a highly advanced humanoid A.I.

Based on your dislike for "Ex Machina", I would recommend avoiding the following movies:

1. "Her" - A romantic science-fiction drama film written and directed by Spike Jonze. The film stars Joaquin Phoenix, Scarlett Johansson, and Amy Adams. The story follows a lonely writer who develops an unlikely relationship with an operating system designed to meet his every need.
2. "Blade Runner 2049" - A neo-noir science fiction film directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green. The film stars Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, and Ana de Armas. The story follows a young blade runner's discovery of a long-
